I gave this 60min presentation in August 2014 in the office of one of my professors in Berlin. Just two people (my two professors) watched. The goal of this talk was to present my Master's Thesis. As part of this thesis, I designed three different-looking magazines with the same content and got feedback from lots of people. The talk answers the question “Can I improve my design through feedback?”.

Here I just show a selection of slides from the talk. **To download the complete PDF, [head over to this Github repo](https://github.com/lisacharlotterost/talk-slides).**
