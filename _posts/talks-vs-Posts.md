In the culture I grew up in, the beginning of a new year is commonly used to make resolutions. If you began to read this article, one of your resolutions might be to give more talks. Or to start giving them.  

Three years ago, my resolution was exactly that. Until then, I mostly had written blog posts. I wanted to use a new channel to communicate my thoughts.

One year ago, I seemed to have succeeded: My new resolution was to give **less** talks. (It's harder than it sounds). Talks are inefficient, I thought. Too much stress. Too little outcome. I wanted to get back to writing blog posts.

This year, my resolution is to have a good balance. I slowly learned the benefits and disadvantages of both speaking and blogging. Here, I will share them:




<br><br>
## When to talk instead of to blog

Here are the main reasons (that apply to the most people) why you should submit a talk at a conference instead of writing that blog post.

- **Your talk is a performance**. The medium is the message, and doing something in front of an audience is hugely important for your message. E.g., you want to live-demo a software / app / tool,  live-code, do comedy / sing / dance. Stuff that a blog post doesn’t transfer.
- **You can’t afford to visit your favorite conference** without speaking (and therefore being paid for travelling, accomendation and ticket).
- **People hang on your lips**, but even your grandma tells you that your blog posts are lame. Some people are just really good at talking (and really bad at writing). If you’re one of them, it would be a shame if you would only write blog posts.
- **You need a deadline** (the conference itself), otherwise you don't get any content production done. No shame here. I'm a pretty disciplined person, but the effectiveness of a public deadline is hard to beat.
- **Nobody follows you on Twitter** – yet. Meaning, it's unlikely that people will discover your blog post anyway. Public speaking is a good way to introduce yourself to the community and build that following.
<br><br>
This list is not exhaustive. Maybe your boss only allows your to talk about your work in an unrecorded talk. Maybe you want to address certain people in the audience, who would not read a blog post by you – yet. Maybe you need a professional recording of your message. There are many reasons, and I’m sure you have your own.

There are also **extra incentives for talking** that writing a blog post don’t offer:

- **You might get money** for your talk.
- **You might get a free recording** of your talk that you can message to your mom. (She'll be proud as heck of you even if she doesn't understand a word.)
- **You get IRL people telling you that they liked your talk**, instead of watching a number next to a tiny heart on some social network go up.
- **You can ask people about feedback**, and because it's IRL, they will answer you if they don't want to be considered incredible rude.
- **Your audience is invested**, because they paid for a ticket and want to make the most out of this conference.
- **Your message can be longer** than a blog post.
- **You can play with more media** than in a blog post. You can have big visuals while talking (they don't even need to be responsive). You can play audio. Or a video, and talk over it and explain things.
<br><br>
If this sounds convincing to you, do submit that talk proposal! But there are also lots of reason why writing blog posts might be the better choice for you:

<br>
## When to blog instead of to talk
- - **You're sincerely annoyed or stressed by some parts of the talk-production-pipeline**, e.g. creating visual slides, rehearsing, pressing your thoughts in exactly 20min, travelling to conferences or actually standing on stage. Or you won't be able to enjoy the conference when you know that you need to speak on the last day.
- **Your content is important today**/this week/this month. It adds to a discourse that's happening now. Or you want to get your thoughts out before someone else does. (Since there's often many months between a talk submission deadline and the actual conference, many conference talks are about general, mid-term to long-term stuff.)
- **You don't know any conference where your message would be a good fit** – or even if you do, there are no speakers or attendees at that conference who you'd like to meet.
- **You want your blog post to be "the original**". When speaking, your live talk will be the original. It lives only for half an hour or an hour. Everyone who want to experience it afterwards needs to see the documentation or recording. A blog post, however, gives all its readers the exact same experience. No matter when they read it. A blog post is the original.
- **Your message is not long enough** for a talk. And your favourite conference doesn't have lightning talks.
- **You're a better writer than speaker**. And you don't want to improve your speaking skills.
- **You want to reach more people** (even if they just skim your article). That’s not always the case. It depends on the size of the conference, if your talk is recorded and the size of your potential blog post readership. I’ve had talks that reached more people as a recording than it would have reached as a blog post. However, that’s the exception.

Again, this list is not exhaustive. I’m sure you have your own reasons why you love blogging and hate talking (if you do, that is.)

## When to first talk, then blog
What to think about when publishing a talk as a blog post

yes, but
your blog post will be very very long
you'll need to adapt the visuals
basicially, you would have done it differently if it just were a blog post
solution: a series of posts!
the medium is the message. Some things you would say in a talk, but not in a blog post. I always feel a bit awkward when writing a blog post.

yes, because
some people LOVE video. You might get a few more people who listen to your
