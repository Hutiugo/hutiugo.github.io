During my time at Bloomberg Businessweek, I designed the information graphics for the back of the 32 American Illustration annual under the art direction of Richard Turley and Jennifer Daniel.

Readability was not the first priority, since the data wasn't life-changing anyway. The graphics should look similar art-like as the illustrations presented in the front of the book.
