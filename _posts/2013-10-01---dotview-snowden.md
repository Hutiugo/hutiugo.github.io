While spending an exchange university in Oxford in fall 2013, I designed the second issue of the "Dotview" magazine. It's based on a magazine concept I created during an exchange semester in Toronto two years earlier.

The idea: **Bringing all the voices of the web into a magazine** – not just articles from big news sites, but comments, forum threads, reddit posts. Everyone was talking about Edward Snowden in 2013, so I chose him as the topic of the magazine. I let a young version of Edward Snowden reveal private information about himself on a young web. To then show how the media reveals everything else about him.

Here are some selected pages:
