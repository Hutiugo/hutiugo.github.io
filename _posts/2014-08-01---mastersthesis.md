For the documentation of my Master's Thesis, I wrote and designed a book with 264 pages and lots of informtion graphics.

They were supposed to visualize the idea of my Master's Thesis, but also how I work, what my design principles are and what I've learned during the process of my Master's Thesis.

Here I show a selection of pages:
