To understand the world, we need to decrease its complexity. But does that mean that we need to dump down our ideas if we want more people to understand them? Not as much as we might think â€“ thanks to the power of design.

With good design, we can communicate our scientific ideas to more people with the same degree of complexity. Or we can show a higher complexity in our ideas, without losing audiences.

In February 2019, I was invited to speak about this topic at **"Designed for science: Complex ideas in clear focus"**, an event focusing on data visualization and design in science, organized by the design unit of the United Nations office in Geneva.

Here I just show a selection of slides from the talk. To download the complete PDF, [head over to this Github repo](https://github.com/lisacharlotterost/talk-slides).
