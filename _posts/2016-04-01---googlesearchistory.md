In 2015, I [downloaded and analyzed my Google search history](/2015/06/20/Searching-through-the-years/). A year later, I did the same – but decided to focus on the things that Google knows about my location & interest in places. I included all search phrases that include a city name, including my attempts to find out directions to a place.

I designed this piece fairly quickly without paying too much attention to detail (as you'll see) – but I still like the design and so decided to include it.
