<p>How do you spend your life? The great blog <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">Wait But Why</a>&nbsp;posted an infographic about measuring your life in weeks some time ago. A few days later, the great <a href="http://jacopoatz.tumblr.com/post/85513207336/i-just-saw-this-ive-been-so-impressed-about-how" target="_blank">Jacopo</a>&nbsp;had an own version on his blog, rebuild in Illustrator. And because Jacopo is so great, he provided me with the Illustrator file &ndash; and I colored the weeks of my life that I have lived so far.</p>
<p>I categorized my weeks in "education" (red), "professional experience" (green) and "the-rest-aka-vacations-or-leisure time-or-organization time". As you can see, I spent more than half of my weeks in my life spent in a school or university. You can also see that my life so far will be very different from my life seen in total: The more I will work in the future, the more the percentage of education in my life will shrink; as well as the percentage of leisure time in my life. Approx. with 70 years, three quarters of the "pie chart of my life" will be green. However, after stop working, the percentage of leisure time (white) in my life will grow again:</p>

<p>In case I will get 100 years old (looking at my ancestors that's pretty likely), I've spent only 1 quarter of my life so far. When seeing my life as 24 hours (as so many comparisons are out there for the <a href="http://images.cryhavok.org/d/18077-1/The+History+of+Earth+in+24+Hours.gif" target="_blank">earth history</a>), that started at noon and will end at noon, it's only 05.47 am. At 6 in the morning, you normally get tired of the party you were on the whole night. At 6 in the morning it's time to start thinking what you want to do with the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One quarter of a life: Doesn't sound so much. But I have to keep in mind: Starting at approx. 6 or 7 pm I will get super tired. (Especially because I stayed up the whole night before.)&nbsp;</p>
