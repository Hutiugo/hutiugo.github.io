In spring 2013, I spent eleven wonderful weeks as an intern at the Bloomberg Businessweek in New York City. It was a huge honor to learn from great, great creative people like [Richard Turley](http://richardturley.tumblr.com/), [Jennifer Daniel](https://www.httpcolonforwardslashforwardslashwwwdotjenniferdanieldotnet.net/), [Allison McCann](http://allisontmccann.com/) and [Evan Applegate](http://www.evanapplegate.com/). Incredibly inspired, I went home and spent a week outpouring the following internship documentation. Although it's many years old by now, I'm still proud of this work (and [this nice review](https://intern-mag.com/lisa-charlotte-rost/) I got from Intern magazine as a reaction).
