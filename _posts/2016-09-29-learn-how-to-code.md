I've started learning how to code many times over again. It began with HTML and CSS when I was 14. Then Delphi in high school. Processing, Javascript & jQuery in university. R on [Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/), Python on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and d3.js with Scott Murray's [famous book](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book), when I got more into data visualization. I'm still not done: More Javascript, more R, more Python are waiting for me.

Two weeks ago I started to learn C, as part of the [CS50 MOOC](cs50.tv/2015/fall/) I'm taking with some of my fellow OpenNews fellows. **And I got reminded of so many feelings I had during all the other code learning experiences before.**

I packed all these steps and feelings the one long GIF you can find at the top – and in a more static comic that one can find below. You might need to zoom in a bit to be able to read it. The uncanny resemblance to the [Gartner Hype Cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) that some people will notice is no coincidence. Also, in case it's not clear: These black shapy things are programming concepts.

Let me know what you think: Have you had similar or other feelings? Am I missing something essential? Write me on [Twitter (@lisacrost)](https://twitter.com/lisacrost) or via [email](mailto:lisacharlotterost@gmail.com).

And here are all the feelings from the GIF up there:

And for everybody who doesn't know how to code yet and is super afraid of it: There are great tutorials these days. They all start incredible easy. And you can always just stop right after the "Unjustified Pride" step.
