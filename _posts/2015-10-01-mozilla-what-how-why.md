I actually never gave this talk. I just prepared it. When meeting the other Knight-Mozilla Opennews Fellows in October 2010 at the Mozilla Festival in London for the first time, we were all asked to prepare a 5min lightning talk for the others with something that excited us lately. In my talk, I wanted to explain the “Golden Circle” by Simon Sinek and how it relates to data vis.

Here I just show a selection of slides from the talk. **To download the complete PDF, [head over to this Github repo](https://github.com/lisacharlotterost/talk-slides).**
