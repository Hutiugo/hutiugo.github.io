Lately I've been wandering around the parts of the data vis field that yields brave men and women who dare to teach. Why? Because in the following summer semester, I myself will teach two courses – one at the Bauhaus University in Weimar (my Alma Mater) and one at the University of Applied Sciences in Bielefeld. And because I believe in copying successful behavior, I started to read syllabi. I wanted to know: What are the most effective ways to teach data vis? Which exercises work best? I emailed some teachers directly with this question, and because this community is as great as it is, almost everybody wrote back.

I gathered the results in a [Google Doc. Click here to see it!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WG_lo8DXQPJDt0hNVvlfciKhZ4u6PnEf5V-OhUkyynw/edit) And then this happened:

<div class="tweet">

Since then, I've never been on this Google Doc without seeing other people having the doc open, too – which creates a very nice sense of community; of "Other people are out there. And they care."

Thanks to everybody who retweeted, had a look at the doc and contributed!
