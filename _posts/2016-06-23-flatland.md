Yesterday afternoon I worked on a small project: I got rid of these annoying things called longitudes and just showed the latitudes of cities and continent borders on a graphic. [I published it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisacrost/status/745731918214344704) and got TONS of feedback. Some people said that the cities are an odd selection, they wanted to know why I picked Paris over Rome, and some wanted a "'add your city to this chart' function". Well, I'm not a fan of that. But I did extend on the original graphic a little bit, to do more justice to more cities.

I might add some other versions in the future. Maarten Lamrechts [said](https://twitter.com/maartenzam/status/745995675654098944) he "Would like to see one with South flipped upwards, y-axis starting at 0", and that seems like a great idea. And both [DDNNNDLNIF](https://twitter.com/Abby_Someone/status/745937245148975104) and [Kavya Sukumar](https://twitter.com/kavyaSukumar/status/745983092892934145) mentioned that they would love to see a version with longitudes. I think that the latitudes are more interesting (because harder to compare on a map) than the longitudes, but it's worth a try.

If somebody wants to tweak these versions etc, go ahead. It's all Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA). [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kN2E2CbIgdY6j_9ANZ3f2x5jJ6xrCMenP2S9ZkTJwAQ/edit?usp=sharing) is the data I used for this graphic; pulled from [geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org/). It contains the ten biggest cities for each country.

**Edit:** Devdutta Bhosale [recreated the same idea in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/devdutta#!/vizhome/Whichcitiesareonsimilarlatitudeorlongitude/Citieswithsimilarlatitude), but on an actual map. And you can compare cities on similar longitudes in his version as well. Thanks, Devdutta!

**Edit2:** [Philipp Bock](https://twitter.com/bockph/status/750388267179208704) [recreated the same idea with React and Redux](https://labs.philippbock.de/latitude/), and you can search for cities and add all ones you want to / have lived in / have a personal relationship to. Thanks, Philipp!

...and [Djam Saidmuradov](https://twitter.com/djamhq/status/750377350722904064) built [a d3 Version](https://djamshed.github.io/data-visualizations/interactive-flatland/) which shows you the capitals, the 20 biggest cities and also lets you search for cities. Thanks, Djam!
