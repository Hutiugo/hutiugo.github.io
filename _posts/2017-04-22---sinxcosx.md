summary: Generating charts in R based on trigonometric functions like sin(x) and cos(x). Lots of fun.
---

In April 2017 I started generating charts in R based on trigonometric functions like sin(x), tan(x) and cos(x). E.g., I would write `plot(cospi(x*abs(tan(x)))*cos(x),sin(x)` in R (after defining x and y as loooong arrays of numbers), and it would give me back a plot, that I then uploaded to a [Tumblr](https://sinxcosx.tumblr.com/).
