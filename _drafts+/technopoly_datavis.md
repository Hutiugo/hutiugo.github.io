Postman is proving that Technopoly sucks with the help of the data and information that he is criticizing --> eg. the medical stuff, hospital deaths through surgery etc. He's claiming that taking data in social science is not a good idea, but if we have more data about how people feel (in the hospital etc.), we can change the situation

Information in Technopoly
=========

- Information overload leads to naivity: "There is almost no fact, whether actual or imagined, that will surprise us for very long, since we have no comprehensive and consistent picture of the world that would make the fact appear as an unacceptable contradiction." – Position 841-845 

What is the problem in the Middle East, or South Africa, or Northern Ireland? Is it lack of information that keeps these conflicts at fever pitch? Is it lack of information about how to grow food that keeps millions at starvation levels? Is it lack of information that brings soaring crime rates and physical decay to our cities? Is it lack of information that leads to high divorce rates and keeps the beds of mental institutions filled to overflowing? The fact is, there are very few political, social, and especially personal problems that arise because of insufficient information. Nonetheless, as incomprehensible problems mount, as the concept of progress fades, as meaning itself becomes suspect, the Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information
Position 871-875 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 10:51:14

To the question “What problem does the information solve?” the answer is usually “How to generate, store, and distribute more information, more conveniently, at greater speeds than ever before.” This is the elevation of information to a metaphysical status: information as both the means and end of human creativity. In Technopoly, we are driven to fill our lives with the quest to “access” information. For what purpose or with what limitations, it is not for us to ask; and we are not accustomed to asking, since the problem is unprecedented. The world has never before been confronted with information glut and has hardly had time to reflect on its consequences.
Position 893-895 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 10:53:48

In 1480, before the information explosion, there were thirty-four schools in all of England. By 1660, there were 444, one school for every twelve square miles. There were several reasons for the rapid growth of the common school, but none was more obvious than that it was a necessary response to the anxieties and confusion aroused by information on the loose.
Position 899-901 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 10:54:54

several methods of controlling information had to be invented. For a richly detailed account of what those methods were, I refer the reader to James Beniger’s The Control Revolution, which is among the three or four most important books we have on the subject of the relation of information to culture.
Position 907-908 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 10:55:43

Information is dangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which it applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves.
Position 961-962 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 11:41:52

Prior to the telegraph, information could be moved only as fast as a train could travel: about thirty-five miles per hour.
Position 998-1000 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 11:45:44

The milieu in which Technopoly flourishes is one in which the tie between information and human purpose has been severed, i.e., information appears indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, in enormous volume and at high speeds, and disconnected from theory, meaning, or purpose.
Position 1001-1002 | Hinzugefügt am Dienstag, 2. Dezember 2014 11:46:11



Filters help us to define morality:

Social institutions sometimes do their work simply by denying people access to information, but principally by directing how much weight and, therefore, value one must give to information. Social institutions are concerned with the meaning of information
Position 1083-1085 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 09:22:19

Courts of law, the school, and the family are only three of several control institutions that serve as part of a culture’s information immune system. The political party is another.
Position 1095-1099 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 09:23:50





all theories are oversimplifications, or at least lead to oversimplification. The rule of law is an oversimplification. A curriculum is an oversimplification. So is a family’s conception of a child. That is the function of theories—to oversimplify, and thus to assist believers in organizing, weighting, and excluding information. Therein lies the power of theories. Their weakness is that precisely because they oversimplify, they are vulnerable to attack by new information. When there is too much information to sustain any theory, information becomes essentially meaningless.
Position 1104-1104 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 09:27:08

the Bible also served as an information control mechanism, especially in the moral domain.
Position 1125-1128 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 09:39:04

Those who reject the Bible’s theory and who believe, let us say, in the theory of Science are also protected from unwanted information. Their theory, for example, instructs them to disregard information about astrology, dianetics, and creationism, which they usually label as medieval superstition or subjective opinion. Their theory fails to give any guidance about moral information
Position 1130-1132 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 09:40:01

the result of which is that they make no moral decisions, only practical ones. This is still another way of defining Technopoly. The term is aptly used for a culture whose available theories do not offer guidance about what is acceptable information in the moral domain.
Position 1204-1205 | Hinzugefügt am Mittwoch, 3. Dezember 2014 15:03:56




the torrent of information which made it impossible for anyone to possess more than a tiny fraction of the sum total of human knowledge. As a college undergraduate, I was told by an enthusiastic professor of German literature that Goethe was the last person who knew everything. I assume she meant, by this astounding remark, less to deify Goethe than to suggest that by the year of his death, 1832, it was no longer possible for even the most brilliant mind to comprehend, let alone integrate, what was known.
Position 1263-1265 | Hinzugefügt am Donnerstag, 4. Dezember 2014 12:43:27


We come to believe that the results of opinion polls are what people believe, as if our beliefs can be encapsulated in such sentences as “I approve” and “I disapprove.”
Position 1285-1285 | Hinzugefügt am Donnerstag, 4. Dezember 2014 12:50:41


bureaucracies, expertise, and technical machinery become the principal means by which Technopoly hopes to control information and thereby provide itself with intelligibility and order
Position 1315-1315 | Hinzugefügt am Donnerstag, 4. Dezember 2014 12:56:32




Our most serious problems are not technical, nor do they arise from inadequate information. If a nuclear catastrophe occurs, it shall not be because of inadequate information. Where people are dying of starvation, it does not occur because of inadequate information. If families break up, children are mistreated, crime terrorizes a city, education is impotent, it does not happen because of inadequate information.

POLLING


The public’s “opinion” on almost any issue will be a function of the question asked.
Position 1902-1904 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 01:04:36

The point is that the use of statistics in polling changes the meaning of “public opinion” as dramatically as television changes the meaning of “political debate.” In the American Technopoly, public opinion is a yes or no answer to an unexamined question.
Position 1904-1909 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 01:05:07

Second, the technique of polling promotes the assumption that an opinion is a thing inside people that can be exactly located and extracted by the pollster’s questions. But there is an alternative point of view, of which we might say, it is what Jefferson had in mind. An opinion is not a momentary thing but a process of thinking, shaped by the continuous acquisition of knowledge and the activity of questioning, discussion, and debate. A question may “invite” an opinion, but it also may modify and recast it; we might better say that people do not exactly “have” opinions but are, rather, involved in “opinioning.”
Position 1911-1912 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 01:05:53

Generally, polling ignores what people know about the subjects they are queried on.
Position 1924-1926 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 01:07:47

political leaders were responsible for the decisions they made. With the refinement and extension of the polling process, they are under increasing pressure to forgo deciding anything for themselves and to defer to the opinions of the voters, no matter how ill-informed and shortsighted those opinions might be.
Position 1938-1940 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 01:09:54

statistics creates an enormous amount of completely useless information, which compounds the always difficult task of locating that which is useful to a culture. This is more than a case of “information-overload.” It is a matter of “information-trivia,” which has the effect of placing all information on an equal level.
Position 1961-1964 | Hinzugefügt am Samstag, 6. Dezember 2014 09:54:12


young children like to count their toes and fingers in order not to be vague about how many they have. Information produced by counting may sometimes be valuable in helping a person get an idea, or, even more so, in providing support for an idea. But the mere activity of counting does not make science.

Principles of Technopoly
=========

formed especially through Taylor’s book The Principles of Scientific Management, published in 1911


- **Expertism is king**
  - "Museums, educational curricula, newspapers, the travel industry, and television schedules are all based on the assumption that [...] we need experts to go through information, ideas, and knowledge and put them neatly away." Position 90-90 & "the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts" Position 745-746
  - **Expertism is ignorant: **"The average psychotherapist, for example, barely has even superficial knowledge of literature, philosophy, social history, art, religion, and biology, and is not expected to have such knowledge." Position 1255-1258
  - **Expertism is possible in all fields, not only technical:** "In the United States, we have experts in how to raise children, how to educate them, how to be lovable, how to make love, how to influence people, how to make friends. There is no aspect of human relations that has not been technicalized and therefore relegated to the control of experts." Position 1255-1258
- **Mesurement is King**
  - "To a man with a computer, everything looks like data. And to a man with a grade sheet, everything looks like a number." Position 232-233 --> lead to:
  - "what cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value." Position 745-746 --> lead to:
  - **Numbers are used to rate unratable things:** "If a number can be given to the quality of a thought, then a number can be given to the qualities of mercy, love, hate, beauty, creativity, intelligence, even sanity itself." Position 218-220 --> lead to:
  - **Polling leads to an accurate image of what people think:** "the technique of polling promotes the assumption that an opinion is a thing inside people that can be exactly located and extracted by the pollster’s questions." Position 1911-1912
  - "The computer, in fact, makes possible the fulfillment of Descartes’ dream of the mathematization of the world." Position 1691-1694 IQ-Test is example, too

- **Accuracy is king:** "what Technopoly insists upon most is accuracy. The idea embedded in the machine is largely ignored, no matter how peculiar." Position 1324-1324 & "Machines eliminate complexity, doubt, and ambiguity." Position 1408-1409 & "We might even say that in Technopoly precise knowledge is preferred to truthful knowledge" Position 2253-2255

- **Efficiency is king** "the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency" Position 745-746
  - **Bureaucracy is king:** "bureaucracy ignores all information and ideas that do not contribute to efficiency." Position 1215-1216

- **Computers are smarter than Humans**: "technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment; that in fact human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity" Position 745-746 & "technique of any kind can do our thinking for us" Position 753-756 & "human beings are, in a sense, worth less than their machinery." Position 778-780 & "information coming from the [human] cannot be taken as seriously as information coming from a machine" – Position 1510-1510

- **Technological progress is more important then human progress:** "It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress." Position 1009-1011

- **Objectivity is King: **"subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking" Position 745-746 & "The printed book [...] helped to create the detached and objective thinker." Position 1428-1430

- **Information can save the world:** "the Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information" - Position 871-875 & "They also believe that information is an unmixed blessing" Position 1030-1032

- **There are no moral institutions:** "This is still another way of defining Technopoly. The term is aptly used for a culture whose available theories do not offer guidance about what is acceptable information in the moral domain."
Position 1204-1205

- **Science is our new religion:** "we believe in the authority of our science, no matter what." Position 825-828 & "Neither Dostoevsky nor Freud, Dickens nor Weber, Twain nor Marx, is now a dispenser of legitimate knowledge. They are interesting; they are “worth reading”; they are artifacts of our past. But as for “truth,” we must turn to “science.”" Position 2274-2277

- **Everything can be turned into Science:** "the methods of the natural sciences can be applied to the study of human behavior. This idea is the backbone of much of psychology and sociology as practiced at least in America" Position 2081-2082

- **Science can provide a morality system:** "faith in science can serve as a comprehensive belief system that gives meaning to life, as well as a sense of well-being, morality, and even immortality." Position 2099-2101 & "It is [...] the illusory belief that some standardized set of procedures called “science” can provide us with an unimpeachable source of moral authority, a suprahuman basis for answers to questions like “What is life, and when, and why?”" Position 2335-2336


"Those who resist the American Technopoly are people who pay no attention to a poll unless they know what questions were asked, and why; who refuse to accept efficiency as the pre-eminent goal of human relations; who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical powers of numbers, do not regard calculation as an adequate substitute for judgment, or precision as a synonym for truth; who refuse to allow psychology or any “social science” to pre-empt the language and thought of common sense; who are, at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding; who do not regard the aged as irrelevant; who take seriously the meaning of family loyalty and honor, and who, when they “reach out and touch someone,” expect that person to be in the same room; who take the great narratives of religion seriously and who do not believe that science is the only system of thought capable of producing truth; who know the difference between the sacred and the profane, and who do not wink at tradition for modernity’s sake; who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest possible form of human achievement." Position 2639-2640
