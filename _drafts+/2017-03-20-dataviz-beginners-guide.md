Welcome! You looked at a graphic and said “man, that looks beautiful, I want to do that, too”? We’re very happy to have you on board. You are important for the scene already, because you ask the questions that make us overthink our approaches, and that force us to explain the basics better.

Man sollte Spaß haben an dem, was man tut – und es sein lassen, wenn man ihn nicht mehr hat.


# How do I make my first data vis?
I’m pretty sure you’ve already made your first data vis. No? Back then, in high school, the bar chart in Excel that didn’t really show you anything new, but hey, it was a bar chart? That counts.

Every data vis is just a bit more sophisticated version of what you did in high school back then. And every data vis you create over time will become a bit more sophisticated (at least in the beginning). Because like every craft, data visualisation is best learnt by doing. So start creating visualisations as quickly as possible. This will not just make you a better visualiser, but also makes you understand two things:

a. Do you actually like the craft? Working with numbers and design is not for everyone. Meaning, Data Vis is not for everyone. So while you might looking at visualisations, you might not enjoy creating them. And that’s totally ok! <br>
b. What skills are you lacking? What do you need to improve to make your visualisations better?


# I really want to start. But I have no ideas! What should I visualise?
* Take a vis and try to redesign it (ZEIT Arbeitslosenkeit).
* Take Census data and try to find out what Flowingdata has done
* Follow a tutorial or a How-To from people out there.
* Choose your favourite topic and try to find data on it
* Read an article that claims something and try to prove it
* Read an article that mentions something in a Nebensatz that makes you wonder and try to dig deeper into that


# But which tools should I use to visualise that data?
Just use the ones you’re already using.
* You’re a business guy who uses **Excel** all day long? Keep using Excel and maybe have a look at Tableau Public.
* You’re a designer who knows **Adobe Illustrator**? Awesome. Get a few Google Spreadsheets skills and top up the Illustrator data vis tools with Raw.
* You’re a creative coder who works with **Processing** or Nodebox? Awesome; learn how to import data and fire away.
* You’ve had a beginner’s course into **R** at university? Heck yeah! Maybe check out ggplot2 for R.
* You don’t know any of the tools and **hate programming**; but still love numbers and design? No problem. Draw, paint or fold your data vis.

# Ok, I did my first data vis. How do I know if it’s any good?
a. Put it next to your favourite data vis and ~~spot the ten differences~~ compare. Why does your look different? What would your favourite data vizzer do? <br>
b. Get feedback from your ~~mom~~ most honest friends.<br>
c. You don’t have honest friends? Post it on Twitter or Reddit. They might be a bit too honest – but you can always choose which criticism you want to listen to and which you want to ignore.

# Hm, ok, I’m not 100% there yet. How do I become better at data vis?
It’s easy to screw up in the beginning. We’ve all done pie charts with 10 slices when we started. Good thing is: There are some simple rules you can learn.

**There are far too many information, your legend is too long and it’s barely readable**?
Set priorities. Always ask yourself: What is the one thing you want to show? What is most important for the reader of the final graphic?

**It doesn’t look well designed**?
Read Tufte.

**Want it more playful**?
Jennifer Daniel

**Better storytelling**?
Hans Rosling, NYT

**More innovative**?
Washington Post, FT, periscopic, look at chart types

**Better dashboards**?
Moritz Stefaner, Stephen Few

**Want it more political and serious**?
Follow Alberto Cairo; check out what your local Open Knowledge Foundation is doing

# Alright, that’s a bit helpful. But actually, I have some problem with x. How do I solve that?
Let me google that for you.
Seriously, google. Because:
1. Not enough universities teach it
2. Technology advances a LOT
3. Everybody else does it too.
If googling doesn’t help, join a Slack of your choice or post a question on StackOverflow (or Twitter if you have enough followers).

# No, I mean, I have some higher level question how to start, and you didn’t cover it.
These are AWESOME NEWS. See, I told you you’re super helpful already! Write me, immediately. I need that question and I’d be very happy to cover it here as well.

# Get into the community?
**In real life**: Conferences (OpenVisConf - more technology; iEVIS - more academic, Tapestry – more storytelling, Visualized, Malofjie)
Check Meetup.com if there’s a data vis meet up in your city. There is none? You’re one lucky person. Create one and use it as an excuse to speak with all the data vis people in your city. You only know one or two? That’s perfect: Meet them, invite them to your meet up, then ask them who else you should meet and invite.
**Online**:  

# Which blogs should I read?
Find people on Twitter, follow them, email them and ask them how they did stuff, get into a conversation with them. (Pro-Tipp: A short Twitter DM is often replied to more often than a loooong email.)

# Some well-meaning tips

1. Blast your work out there. It’s not just for you. Maybe you did something awesome (even if the whole thing might not be your best work yet), that other people can copy. You can help advance the field of data vis.
2. Ask for feedback if you want it.
2. Make your sources prominent.
3. Put your data on Github, and link to it. Even if it’s just cleaned up.
4. Let other people build on top of your data.
