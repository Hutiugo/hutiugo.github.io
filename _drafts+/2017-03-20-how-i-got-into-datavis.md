A life is made of narratives, and this is an important one for me: How I discovered data visualization. At the beginning of 2013 I studied in a design Master's degree, and I still didn't know it's a thing. Yes, I had designed one or two visualizations during my Bachelor's design degree. It was fun. I got the impression that sometimes, designers just design these data things. A few years later I discovered Edward Tufte, one of the most important authors in the field, in a library in Oxford during an exchange semester. I was hooked. I read a book by him or two. It was beautiful. And I got the impression that data visualization is old stuff; and nobody cares about it anymore.

My actual passion back in these days was in magazine design. I designed magazines. That was my thing. It was also the thing of everyone else at my university. That's just what we got taught: how to layout print products. And it was a neat little scene. I went to magazine design conferences; I read the blogs; I had my opinions.

One of these opinions? That the Bloomberg Businessweek magazine looked a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I admired how [Richard Turley](http://richardturley.tumblr.com/), the design director back then, redesign the magazine. A business magazine, after all! I wanted to learn how to design like that.

So I searched the Bloomberg site for information how to intern at the Businessweek magazine. I was not successful. "Impossible," I thought. So on one grey November day in 2012, I asked Richard Turley on Twitter how to apply for an internship. "Come over", [he wrote back](https://twitter.com/Mr_Turley/status/273849106714198016), two hours later. "Your application has been successful."

I was like, "whaaaat". But four months later, I stood at the door of the Bloomberg Tower in New York City. I took a deep breath and stepped in. A few hours later, I found myself in a conversation. "So, what do you want to learn?", I got asked. "We thought about placing you in the graphics department. How would you like that?"

I was not prepared. Graphics? I didn't know what that means. "Like...illustrations?" I asked back. "No, more like...data vis." "Sure, ok."

I didn't know back then that I hit the jackpot. During the next three months, I learnt to understand that they exist: People who do nothing else but create data vis all day long. And these people showed me everything. Where to get data from. How to create pie charts in Adobe Illustrator. What pivot tables are for. They showed me how my love for design and my love for structure, overview & numbers can come together and form something beautiful. And more importantly: That this is something you can become good in. Together with a community. That there is a scene. That there are conferences. That there are people who do these things.

**That you can become a data vis designer.**

So I did just that. I explored magazine design a bit further and also wrote my Master's Thesis about it, but already with a huge focus on data vis. After graduating, I began working for studios and newsrooms team that focus on data visualization.
