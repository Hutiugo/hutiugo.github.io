You want to create news graphics? In newrooms?
That's how you do this:

- Create a project with the clear goal to show your strength.

- Show that you can learn things quickly

- **Make it easy to judge you.** The main question people need to answer is: Are you a good fit? Make clear what your strengths are, and what you'd still like to improve. Write down your process. If you worked together with others on projects, make clear which part you were responsible for: the code? The design? etc. Write down the processes – how you went about creating things, what you learned, etc. People don't know that; you need to explain it to them.


Code problems?
- googling often helps. This will often lead to StackOverFlow, a forum. It'll be your new friend. You will love it.
- investing in books is even more intense.

### Not sure which tool / programming language to learn?
I know the feeling. I still remember asking around, a few years back: "Sooo...should I learn R or Python? I only want to excel in one." It felt like a hard decision. Looking back, I should have sooner started just with *something* instead of asking *which one* for so long. Don't repeat my mistake and decide fast than I did. Here's how:

- If you know people in newsrooms, asking them is indeed a good idea. Writing emails like "Hi, I want to work with you in a year. What should I learn now to be valuable for you by then?" isn't a bad idea. (Imagine the happy you that will write in a year from now: "Hey, remember me...I learned what you suggested and I'm SO ready to join your team.")
- If that feels awkward to you, there are other ways to find out what languages graphics team you're interested in use. The answer is often hidden in interviews (> google!) or conference & meetup talks (Vimeo & YouTube) by people who work. Note that the tools that people use often depend more on the people than the teams, and that tool use can change quickly. If the interview/talk is a few years old or by a person who moved on to another newsroom, the situation might have changed.
- Googling for "which language to learn when I want to do x?" is also a great start. You'll find that you're not alone with the question. If you want a sneak-peak, these 2-hour courses Codeacademy etc. are a great way to quickly get an idea what it means to write a certain language (these courses often include an introduction what a language is useful for).

### Ok, I decided which tool to learn. How should I learn it?
- intro course on Codeacademy / Tutorial. E.g. Mike Scott, d3 / R
- quickly: work on a own project, to know *why* something is important.


### Design problems?
- friends, family test
- writing down what you want to achieve. And then take the text and put it in
- Data Vis Society Slack, critique
- Twitter. Not enough followers?

Journalistic problems? / Not sure if the story is interesting?
